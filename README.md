# Segmentation of H&E stained tissue using Deep Learning
FMAN40, Project in Applied Mathematics

In Digital Pathology, images of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained tissue is
often studied to make diagnoses. An important part of making different diagnoses
is being able to recognize the different cellular components in the image. In this
project we will aim to train a CNN to semantically segment H&E stained prostate
biopsies into four different classes: ‘background’, ‘stroma’, ‘epithelial cytoplasm’
and ‘nuclei’. The results could then be used to count number of cells, estimate
epithelial area etc.
